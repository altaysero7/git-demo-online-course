git stash --> stashing (saving) uncommitted (no "git add ." or "git commit" is done) changes to the stash so that you can move around branches and come back and retrieve them again
git stash pop --> retrieve the last stashed modifications
git stash apply --> retrieve the last stashed modifications but leaves a copy of the modifications so if needed you can apply (or pop) them later in other branch)
git stash list --> can list all the stashes saved
git stash apply stash@{2} --> retrieve the third last stashed modifications (but leaves a copy of it)
git stash drop stash@{1} --> deletes particular stash
git stash clear --> deletes everything in the stash list and clear it
